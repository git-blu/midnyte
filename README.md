# Midnyte LED tablet

Midnyte is an AVR-based resistive touchscreen tablet that uses a 16x24 RGB LED display.
74HC595 shift registers and TLC5940 16-channel PWM LED drivers drive the display and a Semtech SX8652 drives the 4-wire resistive touch panel for user input.
The device can switch between wall power and an internal Li-Ion battery pack.
